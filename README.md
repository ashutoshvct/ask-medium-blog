# medium-analyzer

---Ingestion
- Loading the medium blog (TextLoader)
- Splitting the blog into smaller chunks (TextSplitter)
- Embed the chunks and get vectors (OpenAIEmbeddings)
- Store the embeddings in Pinecone Vectorstore (PineconeVectorstore)

---Retrival
- Get the embeddings from Pinecone Vectorstore, Embedding User Query
- Semantic Search (Relevant Vectors)
- Prompt Augmentation
- Generation


## Overview
This script retrieves information using language models and vector stores based on a given query. It combines different chains to retrieve relevant documents and provide concise answers to questions.

## Functions and Methods

### format_docs
- **Description:** Formats a list of documents into a single string, separating each document by two newline characters.
- **Parameters:**
  - `docs`: List of documents to be formatted.
- **Returns:**
  - A string containing the formatted documents.

## Main Script Execution

1. **Retrieving Information:**
   - The script begins by initializing language models and loading the necessary environment variables.

2. **Creating Chains:**
   - **Embeddings and Language Models:** 
     - OpenAI embeddings and ChatOpenAI language model are initialized.
   - **Prompt Template:**
     - A prompt template is created from the query "What is Pinecone in Machine Learning?" using the `PromptTemplate` class.
   - **Vector Store:**
     - A Pinecone vector store is initialized with the specified index name and embeddings.
   - **Retrieval Chains:**
     - Retrieval chains are created using the `create_stuff_documents_chain` and `create_retrieval_chain` functions, which combine language models and vector stores to retrieve relevant documents based on the query.

3. **Invoking Chains:**
   - The retrieval chain is invoked with the query input, which retrieves relevant documents.
   - A custom RAG prompt template is created to provide helpful answers to the question.
   - The RAG chain is invoked with the query to generate a response using the retrieved documents and the specified question.

4. **Output:**
   - The retrieved documents and the response generated by the RAG chain are printed to the console.
